My [Statistical Power and Significance Testing Visualization. By Kristoffer Magnusson](http://rpsychologist.com/d3/NHST/) now lets you vary effect size, sample size, power and significance level. There's also a new feature to rescale the plot and by clicking-and-dragging you can pan the visualization.
