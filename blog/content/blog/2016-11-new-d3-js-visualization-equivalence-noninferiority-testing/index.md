![Understanding equivalence and non-inferiority testing. By: Kristoffer Magnusson](./img/equivalence-fb.jpg)

I recently published a new explorable visualization of equivalence, and non-inferiority testing. The visualization lets you explore the decision rules associated with these different hypotheses. It also shows how the power of these tests differ, and how they relate to the magnitude of the effect size, sample size, and non-inferiority margin.
