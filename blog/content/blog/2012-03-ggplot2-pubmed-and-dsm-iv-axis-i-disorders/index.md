summary: I searched PubMed for several major DSM-IV disorders and downloaded the hits. Using ggplot2 I plotted the number of publications each year for each disorder

## Introduction

I an earlier post I used `ggplot2` to plot publication count by
year for different psychotherapy orientations. I'm using an updated
version of that R-code in this post to plot publication count for
several major DSM-IV disorders. It's basically like a very simple
discourse analysis.

## The search string

I searched for the following disorders: Depression, Bipolar disorder,
Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity
Disorder (ADHD), Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD), Anorexia nervosa,
Bulimia nervosa, Social phobia, Panic disorder, Generalized anxiety
disorder (GAD), Borderline personality disorder, Agoraphobia and
Specific phobia. The following PubMed queries were used:

*PubMed Search String*

-   Depression[Title/Abstract] (186815 hits)
-   Bipolar disorder[Title/Abstract] (12341 hits)
-   Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder[Title/Abstract] (4294 hits)
-   Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder[Title/Abstract] (5121 hits)
-   Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder[Title/Abstract] (7172 hits)
-   Anorexia nervosa[Title/Abstract] (8634 hits)
-   Bulimia nervosa[Title/Abstract] (3547 hits)
-   "Social phobia" OR "social anxiety disorder"[Title/Abstract] (3418
    hits)
-   "Panic disorder" OR "panic attack"[Title/Abstract] (8542 hits)
-   Generalized anxiety disorder[Title/Abstract] (2965 hits)
-   Borderline personality disorder[Title/Abstract] (3116 hits)
-   Agoraphobia[Title/Abstract] (2352 hits)
-   Specific phobia[Title/Abstract] (424 hits)

## Results â€” the plots

## Conclusion

The word depression is really mentioned much much more often than the
other disorders in articles title/abstracts. Among the other disorders
there seem to be that some disorders have become more popular in the
last decade. Bipolar disorder, PTSD, ADHD and OCD seem to have gotten
some extra attention compared to the remaining disorders. Especially
bipolar disorder appear to really have become the "it" diagnosis in the
last decade. From what I've heard from psychologists and psychiatrists
working in the swedish psychiatry there seem to be some validity to this
conclusion.

## Changes to the R code

I made some changes to the R code since.
Since I'm importing and reading publication year from individual data
files for each disorder, I changed the code to bind each new disorder to
the previous one, generating one variable in `long format`. It would
have made a lot of redundant code to plot each disorder on it's own
`ggplot2-layer`. I also updated the `scrape.pubmed()`-function to now
accept two arguments, where I specified disorder and disorder type (like
mood disorder or anxiety disorder). Another change is that I'm now using
`direct.label()` to remove the legend from `ggplot` and add labels
direct to the plot.

## The actual code used

```r
library(stringr) # used for str_extract()
library(ggplot2) # used for plotting
library(plyr) # used for count()

  year <- str_extract(results, "(19[0-9]{2}|20[0-1][0-9])")
  count <- count(year[year < 2012])
  count$cat <- x
  count$type <- y
  return(count)
}
