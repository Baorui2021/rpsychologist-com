Here's the slides from a talk I gave recently at Stockholm University: ["Power Analysis for Longitudinal 2- and 3-Level Models: Challenges and Some Solutions Using the R Package powerlmm"](/slides/powerlmm-intro-20180411/).

The slides gives several code examples for a lot of `powerlmm`'s functionality, and explain some of the terms I use.
